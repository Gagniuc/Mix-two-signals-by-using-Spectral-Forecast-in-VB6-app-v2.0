# Spectral Forecast equation for signals in VB6

This project uses my own mathematical model published in the journal [Chaos](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5120818). The model is called Spectral Forecast. The Spectral Forecast equation is a part of the Spectral Forecast model and it was initially used on matrices. It can also be used on other multidimensional mathematical objects. Here, a new utility is demonstrated for signals by using the equation on vectors of the same size. This new use on 1-dimensional objects was published [here](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Algorithms+in+Bioinformatics:+Theory+and+Implementation-p-9781119697992). Spectral Forecast equation for signals (VB6 app 2.0) - is a demo application designed in Visual Basic 6.0, that is able to mix two signals in arbitrary proportions. Different cases can be seen, with two different waveform signals that are combined depending on the value of a so-called distance <i>d</i>. This distance <i>d</i> is defined from zero to the maximum value found above the two vectors that represent these signals.
